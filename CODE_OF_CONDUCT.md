## 1. Be Cool

- Don’t be a jerk. If you must be a jerk, at least be a *funny* jerk.
- Sarcasm is welcome, but don’t cross the line into actual meanness. (You know the line. Don’t pretend you don’t.)

## 2. Respect the Shitboxes

- All Cars Matter: that means zip ties and bog rivers are a-okay.

## 3. Help Out

- OR even better get off your arse and fix it and send me a pull request.

## 4. Keep It Legal (Mostly)

- No illegal activity except for everything thats not code theft.  
- You have no licence for this unless I've given you one, act like it.

## 5. Have Fun

- Drive fast, code slow. 'Cause I really can't think any faster.

## 6. Enforcement

- Violators will [shamed](https://plenat-erf.github.io/shitbox-shakedown/shame.jpg)
